## Insertion Sort
The array [8, 4, 2, 9, 3], stats comparing 4 and 8, then swaping 8 and 4 in their places. It continues with the same elements, inserting 2 at start and leaaving 9 in its place as it is in its same place. The entire array is sorted

## Selection Sort
The array [8, 4, 2, 9, 3], from all the elements 2 is the smallest element and swaps with 8, and it finds 3 places in the right position and like wise with all other elements. At last the array is sorted in ascending order.

## Bubble Sort 
The array [8, 4, 2, 9, 3], it starts comparing with first and second position of array i.e. 8 and 4, as 8 is larger number comapred to 4 it gets swap. the larger number continues swapping and comparing with all other element in the array. Finnal the array is sorted in asceding order as [2, 
 3,4, 8, 9] 


## Benchmarks of each sort
The benchmark generates how long each sort takes time to complete. These results are shown by matplotlib. The X- axis refers to input size whereas y - axis as time. All the three algorithms slow down as the array grows larger.
